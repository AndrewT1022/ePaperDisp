**This is the code for Andrew and Kyle's final LSU Microprocessors (EE3752) project!**

It uses a Waveshare 4.2 inch E-Ink Display, an AHT21 module, and an Adafruit BMP280 module.

Our main code is contained within the src folder within epd4in2_V2.ino.

Libraries required: Adafruit AHTX0 and Adafruit BMP280.

Spaghetti code is inevitable.
